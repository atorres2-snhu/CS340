To ensure programs are maintainable, readable and adaptable I like to organize my code.
I look to cut my work into pieces so that I can troubleshoot issues with code and 
reuse code for future assignments as we did in this course. I would use CRUD Python 
in the future when working with adding items such as employee work information, 
customer account creation, etc. 

To approach a problem as a computer scientist I would be very analytical.  I would 
use a divide and conquer method.  This means I would figure out what part of the code
is okay to focus on part of code that could be causing an error. In the future I would
work more on utilizing test code. 

Computer scientist look for continuous improvement of a program.  Where some might see 
impossible, they may see an opportunity to improve. The knowledge from this type of project
would help by creating a template for different applications.  For example, at my
current job they use a lot of analytics which is very similar to how our project 
looked with sorting options, updating information, and information readily available.
